# Home Pal
  This repo's purpose is to create a home dashboard with multiple features and information useful for home managment, useful for display on a tablet

  It is an attempt to see what AI code generator can do with local models and testing it's capabilities

# Functions to add:
- Recycling days
- add ability to set task due, and only display tasks that are due
- implement the train alerts
- recuring shopping list
- add tests

# Persona character:
The persona character image is generated by Stable Diffusion (`Lykon/dreamshaper-8`) and cached in `tmp/persona/`. Images are generated once per weather+time state and reused on subsequent loads.

- **Force regeneration**: delete `tmp/persona/` and refresh the dashboard — new images will be generated for the current state
- **Character consistency**: controlled by a fixed seed (42) and a character prefix prompt in `agents/persona_agent.py`. Changing either requires deleting the cache
- **Quotes**: generated by Ollama and refreshed every 10 minutes. If Ollama is unavailable, hardcoded fallback quotes are used silently

# Setting up Ollama (persona quotes):
The persona character generates dynamic quotes using a local LLM via Ollama. The server starts and manages Ollama automatically — you only need to install it once.

1. Download and install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download
2. The installer adds `ollama` to your system PATH automatically
3. Start the Home Pal server — it will pull the `llama3.2` model on first run (≈2 GB download) and start Ollama as a subprocess
4. On subsequent starts the model is already present and loads instantly

If you prefer a smaller/faster model, change `OLLAMA_MODEL` in `services/ollama_service.py` (e.g. `llama3.2:1b` is ≈800 MB).

# Setting up MQTT (presence & air quality):
The persona reacts to presence (BLE iBeacon via ESP32) and indoor air quality (VOC via Zigbee2MQTT). Both are read from an MQTT broker.

1. Set the broker hostname and topic config in `config.py` (`MQTT_BROKER`, `PRESENCE_TOPIC`, `AIC_TOPIC`, `VOC_FIELD`, `VOC_THRESHOLD`)
2. Create the credentials file `env/secrets/mqtt.json`:
```json
{
  "username": "your-mqtt-username",
  "password": "your-mqtt-password"
}
```
3. Restart the server — it will subscribe automatically and print `[HomeContext] MQTT connected` on success

If `env/secrets/mqtt.json` is absent, the server connects without credentials (useful for unauthenticated brokers).
If the broker is unreachable, the persona defaults to always-home behaviour and logs a retry message every 30 seconds.

# Setting up google calender:
"Please follow these steps to set up Google Calendar API credentials:
1. Go to https://console.developers.google.com/
2. Create a new project or select an existing one.
3. Navigate to 'APIs & Services' > 'Credentials'.
4. Click on 'Create Credentials' and select 'OAuth client ID'.
5. Configure the consent screen if prompted.
6. Set the application type to 'Web application', add authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000/oauth/oauth2callback), and create the credentials.
7. Download the JSON file containing your client ID and secret.
8. Place this JSON file in your project directory and put it in `env/secrets/client_secret.json`
9. Add the users to the test users list.
10. Enable Google Calendar API
